## Communication Procedures:

Communication will be mainly through discord. Through discord we will discuss upcoming assignments and share documents/ideas as well as coordinate team meet ups. If discord is not available email and text will be the secondary form of communication as needed. Assignment documents will be created and stored in a Google Drive folder so all members can collaborate, even when we cannot all meet at the same time. If questions arise we will use these communication methods to clarify or get the help needed to complete the tasks that are assigned. Assignments will be submitted once everyone agrees the assignment is ready for submission.  We will work as a team in regards to instructor correspondence.
