<td>“Since I am a weather geek, I looked at several units and bought this one. Easy to assemble, but be careful as it is a bit fragile so care should be taken. I installed a third-party pole mount bracket on my barn shed and brought a 2" wood dowel rod and raised it up above the roof line. So far, very nice performance. Seems to be really accurate and setting it up on the web was easy. The wind direction seems to move a lot, but honestly, when I am in my yard working I notice variable wind direction all the time. The wind speed is usually lower than reported by Weather Underground....the pressure measurements coincide with expected drops and increases. I have not calibrated the pressure yet, might need tech support for that. In three months' time I have noticed only one anomaly, and that was no rain was reported during one recent rain event, and I thought maybe a leaf clogged something......but two days later it was back to working perfectly. So, I'll leave it alone for now. I like the idea of looking at other people's weather systems, and mine correlates well with those. The outdoor unit communicates seamlessly with the indoor display at a distance of at least 75 yards, maybe a bit more (???). I should have installed Lithium batteries, as you should too.......but I could not find them at the time I needed them, so I used Alkaline. The iPhone GUI reports the battery level and it's still full after three months. 3 AA's required. All in all, great unit. My only concern is how long will it last. Time will tell. If I could add something to the GUI, I would ask for a report over time, stored data for perhaps up to a year that can be presented logically. For example, when I cover my pool I'd like to know how much rain we got in a 1-2-3 month time frame to know when/if it needs to be pumped to keep the water line below wall tiles. Minor point. Have not required Tech Support, so no rating is possible.”</td>

<td><p>“I bought the WS-2902A (precursor to 2902B and C) back in June of 2019, and installed it on my family's saltwater dock. I used a steel curtain rod bought from Home Depot to mount it on. This was my very first PWS, and it served as an excellent entry into the weather hobbyist world. Today (8-12-22) I finally removed it from service, as the solar cells responsible for charging the supercapacitor have deteriorated in the corrosive salt air environment, and I was having to replace the batteries more and more often. Am I upset? No, this unit lasted as long as I expected it to in the conditions I asked it to perform. To repair it, I would need to buy a nearly complete sensor array, and I just elected to replace the weather station altogether.</p>
<p>The Ambient Weather app, website, and supported software (AmbientCWOP) have been great, and the data recorded by my station has consistently passed the NOAA-MADIS QA/QC checks for most variables after I properly calibrated them (wind and wind gust is almost impossible to get past QA/QC). During over 3 years of service, it rode through multiple glances by tropical cyclones (Isaias, Elsa, Mindy, Sally, Dorian, and more), recorded multiple wind gusts greater than 50 mph, endured torrential rainfall, and more. I recommend adding the bird-spike kit and epoxy gluing it to the rain funnel (mine initially slid off). I added some adhesive reflective tape that I thought would keep birds off, and though the tape faded, I never really had an issue with birds trying to roost on the sensor array. I highly recommend this series of weather station for anyone looking to enter the Personal Weather Station (PWS) community.”</p></td>

<td>“As an amateur weather enthusiast I wanted to obtain a weather station that would measure the rainfall in a 24hr period, without me having to get wet to read a manual gauge. Accuracy is spot-on running off the AC adapter for Wind, Rain and indoor/outdoor temp. I would have liked to see the barometer function setup be automated. The desktop display is easy to read although I am not sure how to access any dated log, however there doesn't seem to be one, unfortunately. Tech support is not really necessary as if you follow the instructions you should be fine. That said however, configuring the device on the various weather sites ie WeatherUnderground does need patience. What I am wondering is if the rainfall/wind speed value is reset each midnight, how can the rainfall for the previous day be noted unless noting a change in the weekly/monthly total? What I do not know is how the device will fare in South African sun and how to get replacement parts. Overall a good purchase but not will ALL the bells and whistles.”</td>

<td>“I bought this unit because it is easy to clean in place. However, it is easier for spiders to immobilize the rain cup than the old AcuRite unit it replaced. It rained just 2 days after installation and the unit read 00.00 rain. A spider has built a nest on the back of the cup. I cleaned it out and placed insecticide-soaked rolled up paper towels on each side to the cup and for the next rain everything worked fine. The display is much too small and hard to read from a distance. Also, angle of view is very small in the up and down direction. However, the left and right is OK. Our AcuRite provided the current, average and gust airspeed at the same time. For this unit, you have to punch the "Wind" button to get each of the measurements. You cannot read the wind circle unless you are very, very close to the display. Our AcuRite provided the day (24 hr), month and total rain at the same time. This unit provides the "Event" (not sure what that is), Daily, Month, Weekly and total, but you have to press the "Wind" button to get each. For my old AcuRite, I had to remove the outside unit and take it apart to clean it. For this unit, you can remove the rain funnel and clean in place which I love!!! If it had a better display, I would give it a 5 star.”</td>

<td>“I buy a lot of things on Amazon and I very rarely if ever write reviews. This product and the customer support of the company has moved me to do so. First to say I have owned the Ambient WS-1002 for many years and it was a good product. When it finally died I had ordered the now standard new version the WS-2902. The first problem came with the display. As others have noted it is not of high quality. In fact we sent ours back but received a replacement with exactly the same issues. I can categorically state that the photograph in the product info on line has been heavily edited. The screen does not look this good from any angle. Straight on it looks OK but from even a small angle it can become almost unreadable. It seems to be using color screen technology from around 1990. The second issue came with the external instrument itself. It became apparent after a month or so that it was not reading accurately. We have a number of weatherstations within a close radius so it is easy enough to compare. In fact I am a data scientist so I prepared comparisons of the readings from our unit which were very significantly different from neighboring units that track closely together. I sent this information to Ambient. They did not reply. I followed up with them. They did not reply. I wish I could say I was surprised but I was not as our experience with the display return was that they seemed largely unconcerned with customer issues. I guess if you have 4+ stars on Amazon maybe you can afford to be that way. Anyway if you are in the market for a weather station I would strongly recommend that you look elsewhere.”</td>

<td>I got this weather station for my home office, so I know when to open the windows and turn on off the AC in the summer. The big selling point for this unit was that it shows the humidity for inside and outside, whereas a lot of other units appear to only read the inside humidity. It seems to be very accurate and I've had no issues with range, even with the remote sensor being on the other side of three walls and a floor. The weather forecasts are not always perfect, but I didn't really expect them to be anyways. Overall I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple weather station for their home.</td>

It provides all the information I need. The humidity indicator is great to have because it helps me determine whether or not to participate in certain activities in hot weather. The device that is placed outside is very useful because I can know the temp/humidity when I'm outside. I would absolutely recommend this product.</td>

<td><p>I have to supplement my review and give this thing a serious downgrade. It can no longer maintain a reliable connect to the outside sensor. I've change the batteries, put the sensor: right next to it, across the room, and outside (about 20 feet away). It still loses connection with a couple hours. Every time, I take out the batteries from the sensor and main unit (plus unplug main unit), put the batteries back in, and everything links up. A few hours later, the connection is lost. The worst part is that the main unit does save its setting or fetch the time automatically. That stuff has to be reentered, making it somewhat of a failure as a clock. Now it's a failure as a weather station too.</p>
<p>----- original review below ------</p>
<p>This thing is -nice- and anything negative in this review is intended for the product devs because they seem to care about what they're putting out there. I'm guessing this based on the attention to detail that's apparent from this weather station.</p>
<p>Set up was fast and easy. For a change, I actually checked the manual before powering the device on. The manual had clear instructions about what to do. All I did was follow the directions and the thing was set up. The buttons and stuff for setting it up are easy to press. This was a welcome change from other devices that have you sticking a paper clip through a hole in the back n' stuff.</p>
<p>I ordered this device because it measures indoor and outdoor humidity. That's something I want to know because I use an evaporative cooler and the outside humidity determines how well the cooler will work.</p>
<p>Initial test - set it next to the other clock thermometer device and see if they agree. I put the outdoor unit right next to the indoor unit. All the devices showed pretty close temperature measurements. My old device doesn't do humidity. This weather station's indoor and outdoor unit's humidity measurements were in good agreement. Cool. Now the outside unit really is outside. Nice.</p>
<p>Sooo, what's off or could be done better... It was weird setting the date and time because the weather station doesn't use the time/date signal like all those atomic clocks do. This would be a great upgrade. Especially because you never know when the dates for daylight savings time are going to change again. The time/date signal contains that info.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about the display. It is nice and bright and beautiful. I don't know if it will last a decade like the old school monochrome LCD screens though (and those things last forever). That leaves me a bit unsure because my old device (just time and temp, including outside temp via outside sensor) can run years on a couple batteries and has lasted for well over a decade. So, there's the old reliable and the hot and pretty new. I dunno. Maybe this weather station will be my old reliable many years from now.</p></td>

<td>The unit itself is easy to read and I really like that it provides humidity readings. The issue is that it loses connectivity frequently. (Multiple times a day) I wish I had read all the reviews prior to buying. I have tried everything all the others reviewers have tried (changing batteries, moving the units closer) it works for a while and then stops working. We live in Wisconsin I saw one person mention it stopped working when it was 40 or below. Ours worked at the low temps we have had so far (19 F) so don't think it's that. It just randomly stops working. Very frustrating and wish we could return it.</td>

<p>I returned it and got credit for two items but for the third item, it says it is still not received. I sent two items in a big box and one item in its own box - this is exactly how I got them. Both were sent at the same time. There is no other way of communicating here so I have to put this in my review. Can the merchant check this and issue the credit ? I also sent a feedback and there is absolutely no response from the merchant. I wanted to install this a week ago but the product had wet paint all over and it did not dry after a couple of days. So I decided to return and buy 3 rolls again from another merchant. I now realize that the ones I returned were better quality. Now I think I should probably buy these again and ask someone to ensure they ship me rolls which are dry. This is frustrating to say the lease. I cannot communicate to the merchant- it does not allow me to contact from the order. I am just losing time and patience on this.</p>

<p>It said it has PVC coating. All it had was paint on top of the mesh and my hands got all the paint. Not sure if I install this.

<td><p>Mesh is very flimsy, had to use more clips than I normally would to stop the mesh from bulging out. I bought this brand since its price was about 30 dollars cheaper from RoTak brand I bought last time., so I gave them a shot. Regret it, the RoTak brand came with 100 clips. Now I will have to buy clips separately to finish my install and will come out more than the RoTak brand. The edges on the mesh are not tapered either, so the mesh would get easily get caught on objects and my clothes. Giving two stars only because it came with scissors and gloves.</p>
<p>***update**</p>
<p>after 3 days the pigeons just pushed past it due to how flimsy the metal is. I do not recommend. I had to go back and double the mesh in some parts to prevent the pigeons from getting in.

If the washer was going up against the mesh, a 1" washer would work, but I am installing the wire mesh on solar panels under a decorative skirt and the washer is straddling the gap between the skirt and the panel, and 1" is barely big enough so it could slide in one direction and be pulled into the gap.

I’ve linked its output (via HomeKit) to a smart outlet that controls a heat trace, and so far it’s working as it should. It wishes more of this sensor's data could be displayed via the HomeKit app, but alas. In order to take full advantage (graphs of temp, pressure and humidity over time) you need to use the Eve app, which is reasonably slick so it’s not too much of a bummer.

<td>“I like the IDEA of the Weather: it's well-designed, includes a display, and is HomeKit/Thread compatible. Also, their tech support gets high marks. Unfortunately, there are two issues that led me to rate it more harshly:The LCD display is very hard to read unless it's in bright light. I put it in a protected spot outside our kitchen window. Unfortunately, the display wasn't really readable from about 6 feet away. I tested a different thermometer with an E-ink display, which was great. However, E-ink displays have a narrower operating temperature range (0-50°C). The display problem is relatively minor if you're using your phone to check the temperature. However, the Bluetooth range is a much bigger problem. I added the Weather to HomeKit on my iPhone. The only time I could get it to work was if I was within 10 feet of the Weather unit. That kind of defeats the purpose of having an outdoor temperature sensor. Eve does support Thread, which should theoretically improve the range. I have an Eero mesh WIFI system that includes Thread support, but it's apparently not compatible with the Weather. According to Eve tech support, the only device it works with at this time is the HomePod mini. Even if I had a HomePod mini, I'm guessing it would have to be positioned pretty close to the Weather unit to work.I also tested a remote thermometer from "SensorPush". It doesn't include a display or HomeKit support (though it does have a well-designed iOS app). But more importantly, I can get temperature/humidity readings from anywhere in my house or yard. They claim it has a 325 foot range and I have no reason to doubt that.I don't know why SensorPush has such a long range and Eve Weather doesn't. They both use Bluetooth and both have 3V lithium batteries. Maybe it has to do with the case construction or the Bluetooth antenna. I applaud Eve for supporting the latest technologies like HomeKit and Thread. However, the useful range is even more important to me, so I decided to keep the SensorPush and return the Eve Weather.”</td>

**Product Requirements Document**

**Innovation Showcase**

**Arizona State University**

**EGR 314**

Project Manager: Team 302

Date of Creation: 01/18/2023

Version 1.0

**Introduction**

Weather protection for solar panels is almost non-existent. With our
product we will be able to provide a weather monitoring system that when
a storm is detected will deploy a protective cover to protect the solar
panels from hail and other debris. Users have expressed the need to
protect their solar panels in a quick and simple means.

**Objectives**

The purpose of this project is to create a device that is capable of
withstanding the elements and responding to the environment that it is
exposed to. The design is required to be a unique design that employs
learning and solves a problem. The data that is collected by this device
should also be capable of broadcasting the data collected over WiFi
using the MQTT protocol. The environmental data will be collected via
two serial sensors that will use the data collected to share data with
the user and serve the purpose specified by the user.

**Stakeholders**

**Target group.** Weather enthusiasts, home owners, and students.

**Target purchaser***.* Weather enthusiasts, home owners, and students
that have a focus in STEM careers.

**Customer service.** A device that has simple repairs, is a durable
product, and is budget friendly.

**Marketing & Sales division**. Adequate design that can withstand the
elements and meets all the product requirements.

**Senior Management***.* Ensures compliance to Apple Brand Identity,
determines operational constraints, and sets research and development
budgets.

**Retailers**. Products that are budget friendly and durable enough to
withstand the elements and are able to respond to its environment.

**Regulatory instances***.* The product needs to comply with guidelines
set by the product requirements appropriate for the Innovation Showcase.

**Use Cases**

**User Story \#1: Edward**

Edward, 26 is a young upstart meteorologist intern who finished his
degree several months ago and has been looking for a device that can
track accurate weather information on the go, as he travels a lot around
the country with family for the past year. Ed has been trying to catalog
different weather patterns across the US for his research in order to
get a broad understanding of the northern states’ expected weather in
the Fall.

Edward really could use a device that is highly resistant to the
elements, as well as general wear and tear, but is also accurate to the
nearest degree and mile per hour to track accurate wind speeds. He also
needs a new barometer as his previous one was broken by his little
sister on a flight home from Nebraska.

The WeatherMaster 3000 tracks everything that he needs to catalog, and
more. He has expressed his sincerest gratitude to the development and
marketing teams that sold him it, and it easily travels with him
everywhere he goes with minimal effort. The built-in Wifi unit has
fantastic bandwidth even on spotty connections, and is within almost 25%
of the most accurate readings that are possible for a device of this
type.

**User Story \#2: Keith**

Keith, 82 is the former CEO of a major weather company that has served
the greater Kansas region for nearly 50 years. He lives with his wife
and grandchildren in a small farming community that is not far from
Tornado Alley. Keith has been teaching his grandchildren how to predict
dangerous weather formations, and has been using his skills to help keep
himself and his family safe from turbulent supercells and tornadoes for
the last decade since they moved in from Chicago.

Keith enjoys the WeatherMaster 3000 tremendously, as it accurately can
trace threatening cloud formations and send alerts via an app installed
on the family’s phones if a funnel cloud is moving their direction, and
at what speeds. This feature, he says, is probably his favorite, since
the app uses local cell service to send text alerts instead of
completely relying on Wifi which usually goes down during the worst
kinds of storms, especially if an F5 tornado is spotted.

**User Story \#3: Stephanie**

42 year old Stephanie is a stay-at-home mom with four children who
regularly play outside in their small suburban neighborhood in Colorado
Springs. She loves having the WeatherMaster 3000 at her disposal during
the summer to have on-demand accurate forecasting of potential
thunderstorms, and is able to send the information to her kids whenever
they are out playing to warn them to come home if a storm is going to be
potentially bad.

With the WeatherMaster’s Wifi settings, Stephanie is able to keep a
constant watch on weather patterns without having to subscribe to any
online services, or risk inaccuracies with erroneous forecasts, and can
take the WeatherMaster with her to work, and have it at her desk for
real-time weather updates without it being too cumbersome for her office
space. Stephanie loves the ease of use of the WeatherMaster, and has
recommended it to several of her friends and their families.
